    Main idea is to complete a series of small booklets to be used as guide for each country. What I mean with that?
    Image you just want to travel to another country, maybe youll need several website to update yourself for what you need in order to fit this new destination or maybe to get to know what takes to get a simple documentation. In resume, a guide for the main points of a country topics and questions, what to expect and eventually what documents are need to live there.

    Would be wonderful to see in the future this used to welcome new travelers and see this as a main guide to know another country, beside wikipedia. The beutiful from a open source project is that a small act from a single person is undervalued when eventually small acts and contribute are done.

![EU website]("https://ec.europa.eu/growth/single-market/european-standards/vademecum_nn")
