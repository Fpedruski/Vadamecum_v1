    Main idea is to complete a series of small booklets to be used as guide for each country. What I mean with that?
    Image you just want to travel to another country, maybe youll need several website to update yourself for what you need in order to fit this new destination. A resume for what you need, what to expect and eventually what documents are need to live there. 
</p>

<p>This main idea came when I start to look the vademecum from Italy, there you can find an extense and well ogranized file for what you need to in order to live there, you can find some other example in the 
<span>![EU website]("https://ec.europa.eu/growth/single-market/european-standards/vademecum_nn")</span>and a beutiful open source project called, guia vadecum <span> ![Vadem&cum]("https://www.guidavademecum.it/#idea")</span></p>

<p>
    Would be wonderful to see in the future this used to welcome new travelers and see this as a main guide to know another country, beside wikipedia. The beutiful from a open source project is that a small act from a single person is undervalued when eventually small acts and contribute are done. 

<q>
    Empowerment of individuals is a key part of what makes open source work, since in the end, innovations tend to come from small groups, not from large, structured efforts.
